# MP-Init or Magpiler-Init

A very bare-bones sample project to get started with [Magpiler](https://github.com/jupdike/magpiler/).

Just run `magpiler-dev.js` (or if you have `supervisor` installed globally, run `serve.sh`) to get a development server.

Or run `magpiler-make.js` (or `make.sh` if you have the source repo for `magpiler` next to this `mp-init` folder) to generate the `out/` folder which will contain `index.html`, `index.css`, and `favicon.ico`.
