# Magpiler Sample Website

This is a bare-bones example of how to use [Magpiler](https://github.com/jupdike/magpiler/) to make a single static page (`index.html`) from a Markdown file, a JavaScript [`lit-server-html`](https://github.com/popeindustries/lit-html-server) template, and a static CSS file.

## Modify Me Please

Feel free to add more files and folders in `render/`. Make new templates in `layout/`.

## And Donâ€™t Forget...

Please replace the `favicon.ico` file in `static` with something that is not the Magpiler logo. Thank you.
